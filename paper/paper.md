# Summary
We introduce a new, open-source, Python module for the acquisition and processing of archival data from multiple X-ray telescopes, Democratising Archival X-ray Astronomy (hereafter referred to as \texttt{DAXA}). The aim of \texttt{DAXA} is to provide a consistent, easy-to-use, interface with the disparate interfaces to different X-ray telescope data archives, and their processing packges, thus enabling much greater access to X-ray data for non-specialists. This in addition to providing low-level control of processing for X-ray experts.
