The 'ratio' method compares the count-rate from the FoV with the count-rate in the unexposed corners of XMM observations (i.e. there is an active CCD but the telescope is not focusing photons or soft-protons onto it); an acceptable ratio is defined by `ratio`, and points where the lightcurve ratio is lower than or equal to this are considered good-time intervals.\n",
