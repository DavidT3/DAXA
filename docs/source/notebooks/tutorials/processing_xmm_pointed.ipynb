The histogram method fits a gaussian to the whole-FoV count-rate distribution (in order to find a mean and a standard deviation), and then defines good-time intervals by finding the time periods where the whole-FoV lightcurve count-rate is within `allowed_sigma` of the mean. The 'ratio' method compares the count-rate from the FoV with the count-rate in the unexposed corners of XMM observations (i.e. there is an active CCD but the telescope is not focusing photons or soft-protons onto it); an acceptable ratio is defined by `ratio`, and points where the lightcurve ratio is lower than or equal to this are considered good-time intervals.\n",

    "* **ratio** - The acceptable ratio for the 'ratio' method.\n",
    "* **filter_lo_en** - The lower energy bound used for soft-proton flaring identification; the default is 2.5 keV.\n",
    "* **filter_hi_en** - The upper energy bound used for soft-proton flaring identification; the default is 8.5 keV.\n",
