We make use of the evtool eSASS task for this. Our function will apply the good-time intervals generated by `flaregti`, as well as allowing the filtering of events based on pattern, flag, and energy.

    "* **flag** - Events are flagged during their initial processing (prior to download) - the flags represent combinations of circumstances, and include information on the owner (MPE or IKE), rejection decision, quality, and whether they are corrupted or not. We use a default value that will select all events flagged as either singly corrupt or as part of a corrupt frame.\n",
    "* **flag_invert** - This controls whether the flag is used to define which events to _select_ or which to _exclude_. It is often easier to define the bad events with a flag and then invert it, which is the default behaviour here - any event selected by `flag` will be excluded, unless `flag_invert` is set to False.\n",
    "* **pattern** - Defines which event patterns are acceptable (where a pattern describes how an event was registered by the detector ([this](https://erosita.mpe.mpg.de/edr/eROSITATechnical/patternfractions.html) discusses eROSITA pattern fractions. - the default value is 15, which represent 1111 in binary, which in turn means that single, double, triple, and quadruple events are all selected by default. If the absolute highest quality is required, and you have sufficient events, then it may make sense to limit this more, in which case you could pass 1000 (for singles only), or 1010 (for singles and triples), etc."
