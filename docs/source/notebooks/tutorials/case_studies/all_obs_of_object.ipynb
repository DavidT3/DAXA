This is via the `assemble_archive_from_positions()` function. This function will by default initialise all available missions within DAXA, calls the `BaseMission.filter_on_positions()` method. The return is a list of BaseMission objects that have had the filtering applied, note that if no observations are returned after filtering then this mission is excluded.\n",
