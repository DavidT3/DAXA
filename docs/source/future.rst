Planned DAXA Features
========================

* **eROSITA Commissioning Data** - A new mission will be added that will acquire eROSITA commissioning data, and eSASS tasks to process it will also be added.

* **eROSITA All-Sky Survey Data** - On the release of eRASS:1DE, another mission class will be implemented to allow for the acquisition of eROSITA All-Sky Survey data.

* **NuSTAR Data** - Data can be acquired and downloaded, but not processed yet.

* **Chandra Data** - Another mission will be added for Chandra observations, and processing will be implemented (maybe using scripts provided by CIAO)

* **Swift Data** - Not actively being planned, but under consideration, is support for NuSTAR and Swift - please get in touch if you're interested in contributing.

* **Data Versioning** - A key feature of DAXA will be the ability to version archives, so that any updates to calibration or re-processing will be reflected in a version number and changelog.
