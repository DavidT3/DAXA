    Convenience function to search around a position for observations across multiple missions. By
    default this function will search all available missions supported by DAXA. This will set up 
    Mission objects and filter their observations based on the input positions and search_distance
    argument. If a mission does not have any observations matched after the filtering, they will not
    be included in the dictionary output.

    :param list/np.ndarray/SkyCoord positions: The positions for which you wish to search for observations. They
        can be passed either as a list or nested list (i.e. [r, d] OR [[r1, d1], [r2, d2]]), a numpy array, or
        an already defined SkyCoord. If a list or array is passed then the coordinates are assumed to be in
        degrees, and the default mission frame will be used.
    :param Quantity/float/int/list/np.ndarray/dict search_distance: The distance within which to search for
        observations by this mission. Distance may be specified either as an Astropy Quantity that can be
        converted to degrees (a float/integer will be assumed to be in units of degrees), as a dictionary of
        quantities/floats/ints where the keys are names of different instruments (possibly with different field
        of views), or as a non-scalar Quantity, list, or numpy array with one entry per set of coordinates (for
        when you wish to use different search distances for each object). The default is None, in which case a
        value of 1.2 times the approximate field of view defined for each instrument will be used; where different
        instruments have different FoVs, observation searches will be undertaken on an instrument-by-instrument
        basis using the different field of views.
    :param list[str] missions: list of mission names that will have the filter performed on. If set 
        to None, this function will perform the search on all missions available within DAXA.
    :return: A dictionary of missions that have observations associated with them. The keys are 
        strings of the mission's names, and the values are the Mission objects that have had the
        filtering applied and have found matching observations.
