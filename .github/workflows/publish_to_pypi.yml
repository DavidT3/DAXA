# This action triggers the second stage of publishing this module. When a new release is created this action will begin. It builds the module, then
#  publishes it to the real PyPI index


# The overall name of the action
name: Publish DAXA to real PyPI, triggered on creation of release

# This action triggers when there is a release to the repo, but only when the release is published
